# HW2

## What I Have Done (In HW requirements)
1. Baseline. (can switch between images)
2. Disabling the next (previous) button when it reaches the last (first) image.
3. The "Nice to have." (Displaying `images/loading.gif` while loading image) (Though hard to actually see that gif since the loading is so quick)

## What I Have Done (Beyond the required scope)
1. Handling the special case when there is **only one** image in the list. In that case, both of the buttons are disabled. See below. (implementation: the function `check()`)

2. Showing **the index of current image** below the image. See below.
